# QUIC Encryption Offload (QEO)

> **Note**
> This document is a work in progress.

This document describes a proposed NDIS offload called QEO which offloads the encryption (and decryption) of QUIC short header packets to hardware. The perspective is mainly that of MsQuic, but the offload will be usable by other QUIC implementations.

Today, MsQuic builds each QUIC packet by writing headers and copying application data into an MTU-sized (or larger in the case of USO) buffer, uses an encryption library (bcrypt or openssl) to encrypt the packet in place, and then posts the packet (alone or in a batch) to the kernel. When running MsQuic in "max throughput" mode (which parallelizes QUIC and UDP work), for bulk throughput scenarios (i.e., large file transfers), as much as 70% of a single CPU may be consumed by encryption. This constitutes the single largest CPU bottleneck in the scenario; and the single largest opportunity for offloading to hardware.

Developers of other QUIC implementations have claimed a 5-8% memory bandwidth reduction from combining the application data copy with encryption. Moreover, if the work can be offloaded to hardware, those developers have claimed the main CPU can be relieved of 7% of the CPU utilization of QUIC.


## UDP Segmentation Offload (USO)

> **Note**
> This section is not directly about QEO, but provides context on an existing offload with which there may be interactions.

Today, MsQuic uses USO on Windows to send a batch of UDP datagrams in a single syscall. It first calls `getsockopt` with option `UDP_SEND_MSG_SIZE` to query for support of USO, and then calls `setsockopt` with `UDP_SEND_MSG_SIZE` to tell the USO provider the MTU size to use to split a buffer into multiple datagrams. Once the MTU has been set, QUIC calls `WSASendMsg` with a buffer (or a chain of buffers according to `WSASendMsg` gather semantics) containing multiple datagrams. The kernel creates a large UDP datagram from this buffer and posts it to the NDIS miniport, which breaks down the large datagram into a set of MTU-sized datagrams.

QEO is orthogonal to USO and usable either with or without it: if USO is enabled, then the app can post multiple datagrams in a single send call; and if QEO is enabled, the datagram[s] are posted unencrypted.

Windows documentation can be found [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/network/udp-segmentation-offload-uso-). MsQuic also uses the equivalent Linux API ([GSO](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/networking/segmentation-offloads.html#generic-segmentation-offload)).


## Linux API

> **Note**
> The Linux interface is also a work in progress. The following indicates the current state of the proposal.

Linux developers are working on a send-side kernel/hardware encryption offload. See [here](https://lore.kernel.org/all/97789971-7cf5-ede1-11e2-df6494e75e44@gmail.com/). The focus on sender side is justified by the claim that server-side networking is typically send-dominant.

The general API in Linux is:

- The app associates a connection ID with encryption params (key, iv, cipher) with socket option `UDP_QUIC_ADD_TX_CONNECTION`. This state is removed when the socket is closed, or it can be removed explicitly with `UDP_QUIC_DEL_TX_CONNECTION` (there is discussion ongoing about using tuples instead of or alongside connection ID).

- GSO is optionally set up with socket option `UDP_SEGMENT` (this value can be overridden per-send with ancillary data).

- Sendmsg is called with some ancillary data: the connection ID length, the next packet number, and a flags field.

- On key rollover, the app plumbs the new key.

If a hardware offload is supported by the network interface, then it is used; otherwise the kernel takes care of the encryption and segmentation for usermode.


# Winsock API

The proposed Winsock API for QEO is as follows.


## Checking for QEO Capability

An app first checks for QEO support by querying the `SO_QEO_SUPPORT` socket option. The option value is a `QEO_SUPPORT` structure describing the supported algorithms:

```C
typedef struct {
    uint8_t Receive : 1;
    uint8_t Transmit : 1;
    uint8_t Aes128Gcm : 1;
    uint8_t Aes256Gcm : 1;
    uint8_t ChaCha20Poly1305 : 1;
    uint8_t Aes128Ccm : 1;
    uint32_t QuicVersionCount;
    uint32_t QuicVersions[1]; // Variable length
} QEO_SUPPORT;
```

### Parameters

#### Receive

This bit indicates the decryption offload for the receive path is supported.

#### Transmit

This bit indicates the encryption offload for the transmit path is supported.

#### Aes128Gcm

This bit indicates the AEAD_AES_128_GCM cryptographic algorithm is supported.

#### Aes256Gcm

This bit indicates the AEAD_AES_256_GCM cryptographic algorithm is supported.

#### ChaCha20Poly1305

This bit indicates the AEAD_CHACHA20_POLY1305 cryptographic algorithm is supported.

#### Aes128Ccm

This bit indicates the AEAD_AES_128_CCM cryptographic algorithm is supported.

#### QuicVersionCount

This field indicates the number of items in the `QuicVersions` array.

#### QuicVersions

This array indicates the set of support QUIC version numbers that are supported.

### Return value

If no error occurs, `getsockopt` returns zero. If QEO is not supported by the operating system, then the `getsockopt` call will fail with status `WSAEINVAL`. This should be treated the same as the case where no cipher types are supported (i.e. the app should encrypt its own QUIC packets).

### Remarks

Since this structure is an indication of what (possibly partial) support level exists from the offload, some of the bits likely will not be set. But there are certain sets of bits where at least one of them must be set.

- Either `Receive` or `Transmit` must be set.
- Either `Aes128Gcm`, `Aes256Gcm`, `ChaCha20Poly1305`, or `Aes128Ccm` must be set.
- `QuicVersionCount` must be at least one.

> **TODO -** The "support" only makes sense in the context of a particular interface. If the socket is bound first then it's clear which interface we want to query; but what about unbound sockets?


## Establishing Encryption Parameters for a Connection

If QEO is supported, the app then establishes crypto parameters for a connection by setting the `SO_QEO_CONNECTION` socket option with an option value of type `QEO_CONNECTION`.

```C
typedef enum {
    AesGcm128,
    AesGcm256,
    ChaCha20Poly1305,
    AesCcm128
} QEO_CIPHER_TYPE;

typedef struct {
    BOOLEAN IsAdd;
    BOOLEAN IsTransmit;
    uint32_t QuicVersion;
    NDIS_QUIC_CIPHER_TYPE CipherType;
    uint8_t PayloadKeyLength;
    uint8_t PayloadKey[32];
    uint8_t HeaderKeyLength;
    uint8_t HeaderKey[32];
    uint8_t PayloadIv[12];
    uint16_t Port;
    ADDRESS_FAMILY AddressFamily;
    uint8_t Address[16];
    uint8_t ConnectionIdLength;
    uint8_t ConnectionId[MAX_CID_LENGTH];
} QEO_CONNECTION;
```

> **TODO -** support adding N and removing M connections in one request for key update


## Sending Packets

The app then calls `WSASendMsg` with an unencrypted QUIC packet (or, if USO is also being used, a set of unencrypted QUIC packets). The packet[s] must be smaller than the current MTU by the size of the authentication tag, which is currently 16 bytes for all supported ciphers. This leaves space for the tag to be added to the packet during encryption.

The app passes ancillary data to `WSASendMsg` in the form of `QEO_ANCILLARY_DATA`:

```C
typedef struct { 
    uint64_t NextPacketNumber; 
    uint8_t ConnectionIdLength;  
} QEO_ANCILLARY_DATA;
```

`NextPacketNumber` is the uncompressed QUIC packet number of the packet (or of the first packet in the batch). This is passed down because the uncompressed packet number is an input for encryption and because the offload provider cannot read the packet number from the packet buffer without dealing with packet number compression.

The `ConnectionIdLength` is passed to help the offload provider read the connection ID (which is used as a lookup key for the previously-established encryption parameters) from the packet buffer.

# NDIS API

The NDIS interface for QEO is used for communication between TCPIP (which posts NBLs containing unencrypted QUIC short header packets) and the NDIS miniport driver (which encrypts and sends the QUIC packets).


## Configuring and Advertising QEO Capability

The miniport driver advertises QEO capability during initialization with the `QuicEncryption` field of an `NDIS_OFFLOAD` structure (with `Header.Revision = NDIS_OFFLOAD_REVISION_8` and `Header.Size = NDIS_SIZEOF_NDIS_OFFLOAD_REVISION_8`), which is passed to `NdisMSetMiniportAttributes`. The `QuicEncryption` field is of type `NDIS_QUIC_ENCRYPTION_OFFLOAD`:

```C
typedef struct {
    uint8_t Receive : 1;
    uint8_t Transmit : 1;
    uint8_t Aes128Gcm : 1;
    uint8_t Aes256Gcm : 1;
    uint8_t ChaCha20Poly1305 : 1;
    uint8_t Aes128Ccm : 1;
    uint32_t QuicVersionCount;
    uint32_t QuicVersions[1]; // Variable length
 } NDIS_QUIC_ENCRYPTION_OFFLOAD;
```

QEO can be enabled or disabled using `OID_TCP_OFFLOAD_PARAMETERS` with the `QuicEncryption` field of the `NDIS_OFFLOAD_PARAMETERS` struct. The `QuicEncryption` field is of type `NDIS_QUIC_ENCRYPTION_OFFLOAD`, described above. After the miniport driver handles the OID, it must send an `NDIS_STATUS_TASK_OFFLOAD_CURRENT_CONFIG` status indication with the updated configuration.

The current QEO configuration can be queried with `OID_TCP_OFFLOAD_CURRENT_CONFIG`. NDIS handles this OID and does not pass it down to the miniport driver.

> **TODO -** what happens to existing plumbed connections when the config changes? (e.g. what if a connection was using a cipher type and that cipher type has been removed?)


## Establishing Encryption Parameters for a Connection

> **TODO -** what type of OID to use for `OID_QUIC_CONNECTION_ENCRYPTION`? Some OIDs have high latency. If no type of OID is fast enough, perhaps instead of OID to plumb a connection, use a special OOB in first packet.

> **TODO -** specify how many connections can be offloaded?

Before the NDIS protocol driver posts packets for QEO, it first establishes encryption parameters for the associated QUIC connection by issuing `OID_QUIC_CONNECTION_ENCRYPTION`. The `InformationBuffer` field of the `NDIS_OID_REQUEST` for this OID contains a pointer to an `NDIS_QUIC_CONNECTION`:

```C
typedef enum {
    AesGcm128,
    AesGcm256,
    ChaCha20Poly1305,
    AesCcm128
} NDIS_QUIC_CIPHER_TYPE;

typedef struct _NDIS_QUIC_CONNECTION {
    BOOLEAN IsAdd;
    BOOLEAN IsTransmit;
    uint32_t QuicVersion;
    NDIS_QUIC_CIPHER_TYPE CipherType;
    uint8_t PayloadKeyLength;
    uint8_t PayloadKey[32];
    uint8_t HeaderKeyLength;
    uint8_t HeaderKey[32];
    uint8_t PayloadIv[12];
    uint16_t Port; // Destination port.
    ADDRESS_FAMILY AddressFamily;
    uint8_t Address[16]; // Destination IP address.
    uint8_t ConnectionIdLength;
    uint8_t ConnectionId[MAX_CID_LENGTH];
} NDIS_QUIC_CONNECTION;
```

The protocol driver later deletes the state for the connection with `OID_QUIC_CONNECTION_ENCRYPTION`. The `InformationBuffer` field of the `NDIS_OID_REQUEST` for this OID also contains a pointer to an `NDIS_QUIC_CONNECTION`, but only the `Port`, `Address Family`, `Address`, `ConnectionIdLength`, and `ConnectionId` fields are used.


## Sending Packets

> **TODO -** packet coalescing (multiple QUIC packets per datagram)??

The NDIS protocol driver posts packets for QEO with OOB data (which can be queried using the `NET_BUFFER_LIST_INFO` macro with an `_Id` of `QuicEncryptionOffloadInfo`) with the following format:

```C
typedef struct _NDIS_QUIC_ENCRYPTION_NET_BUFFER_LIST_INFO {
    uint64_t NextPacketNumber;
    uint8_t ConnectionIdLength;
} NDIS_QUIC_ENCRYPTION_NET_BUFFER_LIST_INFO;
```

NOTE: Normally the encryption parameters for the associated connection will have been established with `OID_QUIC_CONNECTION_ENCRYPTION` for every QEO packet that is posted, but this is not guaranteed. If a QEO packet is posted and no matching encryption parameters are established, the `NET_BUFFER_LIST` must be immediately completed by the miniport without transmitting the packet. (**TODO**: with what status code?)

> **TODO -** Miniport will have to compute checksums

> **TODO -** Explicitly mention that usage of QEO with USO must be supported.

> **TODO -** What about nonsequential packets? If weâ€™re just passing a `NextPacketNumber` then how will that work?


## Receiving Packets

> **TODO -** When decryption fails, what to do? (two cases: connection hasn't been plumbed, and connection has been plumbed but decryption fails due to invalid packet)

> **TODO** everything else
